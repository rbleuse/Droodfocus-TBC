All DroodFocus's skins and configs have been created for a resolution of 1280/1024 pixels and a UI scale set to minimum.
I add config "DefaultLowRes" for people that use High UI scale.
"DefaultWithTarget" is the same as default but with statut bar for target hp.
* Some optimizations in handling the threat
* Target HP is now a statut bars like health or mana bar (Used in skin "CompactWithTarget")
* when windows are not linked, you can move all the elements of the HUD with mouse
* Adding a system to count the number of times where your rip was increased by the "glyph of shred".
* New option for the (de)buffs icon's timers
By default, timers overlay are 'childrens' of the icons created specifiquely by DroodFocus.
In this version, you can specify new "parent" for this texts (like actionbutton or other).
Simply select the (de)buffs in the DroodFocus debuff's list, click on "Sel." button (for selection) next to the editbox "Parent" and move the mouse pointer over the desired object and press enter. Press "Apply" button to applying and see the change.
All interface elements that have a name can be used and you can use the same parent for several debuffs, however, they may sometimes be superposed because DroodFocus will not affect the visibility of the object that were not created by DroodFocus.
It is a very practical approach to display timers but asked to take a few times to configure all.
It is therefore impossible to create a default configuration for this type of setting. You can show an example with Bartender4 in screenshots.
You can play ;)

The timerbars flashing at the end of the timer.
Proportional mode: by default, the value of the timerbars is between 0% and 100%. 100% being the maximum duration of the debuff.
In the proportional mode, the value is fixed. It extends to all the bars from 0 up to 12 seconds (changeable in options).
